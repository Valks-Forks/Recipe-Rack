# Recipe-Rack

This is a simple C# WPF App that Reads and Writes recipes into .json files. Allowing the user to have an easy way to save their favorite recipes.

The application generates the following directories.

(User Documents) //Recipe Rack

(User Documents) //Recipe Rack//Recipes - This is where the users recipe files are stored.

(User Documents) //Recipe Rack//Tips - This is where the users Tips document is stored.

*This Application is a very simple WPF C# project. It was my first "full featured" project start to finish and could definitely be restructured with better coding practices. I tried to ensure it was as bug free as possible, however the .json files are not error checked and if those are altered outside the program incorrectly it could cause issues with the program.
